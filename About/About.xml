    <description>Now updated to 1.5, which is a game update that introduces books to the base game. This mod is still viable: It allows you to write books, as well as newspapers. Vanilla Books Expanded is a mod allowing your colonists to pass their knowledge and skill to others. By writing a book about a particular field of science or skill, pawns will transfer their insights and knowledge, and when read, such books will train others in the same skill.

Books take a long time to write - no one writes a book overnight, but they increase in quality and value the more skilled your colonist is in that particular field of study. With this mod you can build massive libraries and have pawns enjoy the books in their schedule.
